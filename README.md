# Rule_engine_with_ast
# Rule Engine with AST

This project is a **Rule Engine Application** that uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to evaluate and determine user eligibility based on various attributes such as age, department, income, spend, and more. The application is built as a 3-tier system with a **User Interface (UI)**, **API**, and **Backend** that supports dynamic rule creation, combination, and modification.

## Features

- **Dynamic Rule Creation**: Create, modify, and delete rules based on user attributes.
- **Rule Storage**: Stores rules in a database for persistence.
- **Eligibility Determination**: Uses AST to evaluate rules for determining user eligibility.
- **3-Tier Architecture**: Separates the UI, API, and backend for improved scalability.
- **Customizable**: Supports multiple attributes and rule modifications.
